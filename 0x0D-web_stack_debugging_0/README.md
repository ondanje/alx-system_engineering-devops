## Webstack Debugging Project
## Overview
The Webstack Debugging series aims to enhance your debugging skills as a Full-Stack Software Engineer. Debugging is a crucial skill in ensuring that computers and software work as intended, making it an essential part of the job.

In this project, you will encounter broken or bugged webstacks, and your objective is to develop a Bash script that, when executed, rectifies the issues, bringing the webstack to a functional state. Before scripting, however, you'll need to identify the problems and fix them manually.
