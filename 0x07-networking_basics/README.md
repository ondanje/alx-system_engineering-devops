## Introduction

Networks are the backbone of modern communication. This section introduces the importance of networking, its applications, and key concepts you need to understand.

## OSI Model

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a fundamental framework for understanding how different networking protocols interact. Learn about the seven layers of the OSI model and their respective functions.

## IPv4

IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) is the most widely used IP protocol for routing data across the Internet. This section covers IPv4 addressing, subnetting, and common IPv4-related concepts.

## IPv6

IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) is the successor to IPv4 and addresses the limitations of IPv4, such as address exhaustion. Explore IPv6 addressing, transition mechanisms, and the benefits it brings.

## TCP/IP

TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is the foundation of the Internet. Learn how this suite of protocols enables data communication over networks.

## Networking Protocols

Understand the role of various networking protocols, including HTTP, FTP, DNS, DHCP, and more. Explore how these protocols work and their specific use cases.

## Subnetting

Subnetting is a crucial skill for network administrators. Discover how to divide IP address spaces into smaller, more manageable subnetworks.

## Network Security

Security is paramount in networking. Explore basic network security principles, including firewalls, encryption, authentication, and best practices for securing your network.

## Troubleshooting

When network issues arise, troubleshooting skills are essential. This section provides tips and techniques for identifying and resolving common networking problems.
